If you want to run the code locally, you'll need the token and endpoints. You can get those [here](https://aerolab.us/coding-challenge). Then create your own ```.env.local``` and config your variables.

To start, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn add
```

Then you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
